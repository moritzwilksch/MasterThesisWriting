\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Data Sources}
English-speaking users who discuss finance and investing on online social media platforms in text form do so on three major platforms: Reddit, StockTwits, and Twitter. Reddit is a SNS on which users can create their own communities (``subreddits'') that focus on a specific topic. For example, users have created the subreddits ``Investing'' and ``StockMarket'' to discuss long-term investments and the subreddit ``WallStreetBets'' for posts about high-risk short-term gambles in the market. However, posts on Reddit tend to be much longer than posts on Twitter or StockTwits. Their length would require them to be analyzed on a paragraph- or sentence basis. Since research on SA is mostly focused on document-level analysis, we will not use Reddit posts for this work. The decision between StockTwits and Twitter is harder: posts on both platforms are similar in length and share the usage of cashtags (a ``\$'' sign followed by a ticker symbol) for identifying stocks. We decide to obtain data from Twitter rather than StockTwits for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The post volume on Twitter is higher than it is on StockTwits.
	\item The few data sets for SA on financial SM posts that exist use data from StockTwits, hence publishing a data set of Tweets provides more value to the research community.
	\item By using Twitter data for our experiments we can answer RQ4 and compare performances between models and data sources.
\end{enumerate}

A disadvantage of the Twitter platform is that -- unlike StockTwits -- the majority of tweets are not related to finance and investing. As a remedy, we utilize cashtags for searching investment-related posts on Twitter. These tags are only used when referring to publicly traded companies as financial entities, as each cashtag contains the company's stock ticker symbol. This mostly prevents generic tweets about a company's brand or products from spilling into the collected data and allows us to focus the artifact design process on financial social media posts.

\subsubsection{Sampling}

The first step to collecting data on Twitter is assembling a search query because the Twitter search application programming interface (API) requires users to search for specific cashtags instead of any Tweet containing cashtags. To make results comparable to the previous literature we will focus on English posts only. Therefore, as a starting point for selecting ticker symbols to include in the search query, we use the S\&P500 index. From there, we impose a minimum activity filter on each stock ticker: a ticker is only considered to be actively discussed on Twitter if there are more than 100 tweets per day on average mentioning it. Without such a filter, there is a risk of few Twitter users representing the ``public'' sentiment of a company. To conduct the filtering, we collect data on the number of tweets per day for every S\&P500 ticker during April of 2022. As Figure \ref{figure-tweet-activity} demonstrates, the distribution of activity is highly skewed. The top 20 tickers account for 53.7\% of all tweets about S\&P500 companies. 56 tickers fulfill the minimum activity constraint and account for 70.9\% of tweet volume. Out of these 56, we manually exclude 6 tickers (\texttt{AME, OGN, TEL, AMP, KEY, STX}) because while they represent corporations listed in the S\&P500 index, they are mostly used to reference cryptocurrencies on Twitter. This is problematic as the domain of cryptocurrencies is fundamentally different from the equity market. Financial instruments like options do not exist for cryptocurrencies and they are also not affected by any kind of fundamental information. Thus, we decide to remove them from the data set and focus on publicly traded companies.

The top 20 tickers (out of 505) produced 53.7\% of all tweets, top 56 produced 70.9\%
