\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item interesting: finbert + twitter roberta are better than domain specific dictionary AND perform equally well but come from different adjacent domains
	\item make paragraph structure follow methodology flowchart!
	\item ref the performance decrease on finsome, it's related to the dataset differences and the model overfitting
	\item ref word embeddings: using generic ones (glove) is not a good idea
	\item ref Renault findings re: dataset size
	\item differentiating between uncertain and no sentiment is a hard task. performance does not warrant building a 4-class model, so just stick to three classes. It was also hardest to label!
	\item ``Recommend SA model for different use cases'' (see DSR flowchart)
