\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item interesting: finbert + twitter roberta are better than domain specific dictionary AND perform equally well but come from different adjacent domains
	\item make paragraph structure follow methodology flowchart!
	\item ref the performance decrease on finsome, it's related to the dataset differences and the model overfitting
	\item ref word embeddings: using generic ones (glove) is not a good idea
	\item ref Renault findings re: dataset size
	\item ``Recommend SA model for different use cases'' (see DSR flowchart)
